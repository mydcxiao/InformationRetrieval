As we can see, the average percent overlap and average Spearman coefficient of Google and Bing results are 18.6% and -6.84 respectively. The low average overlap indicates that they have a low number of overlapping results. Besides, the negative Spearman correlation coefficient indicates that those overlapping results are uncorrelated. So not only Google and Bing use different ways to retrieve the URLs related to the queries, they also emphasize different ranking features.
